<p>This collection of links should help get you oriented in the world of fundraising at the ASF.</p>
<p>The fundraising team also meets monthly for roughly 90 minutes on a Skype call to cover action items, calendar review and general planning. We post the agenda on Google Workspace prior to the meeting. Unfortunately, the meeting does not happen on the same day and at the same time every month. To receive an invitation to the next meeting, please contact fundraising@. At the end of the call each month, we set the date and time for the next meeting.</p>

<h4>FAQs</h4>
<p>A number of questions come up during regular interactions with sponsors and volunteers. This section is a living list of common questions and answers, as well as documentation around various policies</p>
<h5>What is the runbook/lifecycle of sponsorship?</h5>
<p>There are several phases to a sponsorship relationship. We track recent touchpoints for each sponsor and any information needed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Pj86GmvgAGurHGjJJlSXOYCIVUynkLxHGPUfuq9Xnk/edit#gid=0">Master Tracking List</a>. <strong>We note all activities in the tasks below in the tracking sheet</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identification/searching - The whole fundraising team typically does this. We spend this phase of the relationship seeking out potential sponsors and establishing initial contact.</li>
<li>Courtship - Handled by <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-fundraising">VP Fundraising</a>, <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-sponsor-relations">VP Sponsor Relations</a> and often involving <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-marketing">VP Marketing and Publicity</a>. This is the most attention-intensive phase of the sponsorship lifecycle. Starting after the initial contact with the potential sponsor, we present them with information about how and why a sponsorship is right for them. This phase concludes with a decision whether to sponsor the ASF. Regular email and synchronous communication occurs: everything from tedius scheduling meetings to in-person conversations with high-level leadership at the sponsor's organization.</li>
<li>Ongoing relationship - This phase starts after a decision is made whether to sponsor the ASF.
<ol>
<li>Sponsored (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQknnfWe6tSIWBP9tqRasjx-XNO9WxX2j2zkHpW_scQ/edit">full policy</a>) - Handled by <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-fundraising">VP Fundraising</a>, <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-sponsor-relations">VP Sponsor Relations</a>, <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/accounting">Accounting</a> and often involving <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-marketing">VP Marketing and Publicity</a>. After the terms (level, recurrence, etc) are agreed to:
<ol>
<li>Agreement - We capture the agreed-to sponsorship level and invoice amounts in a sponsorship agreement which we send via electronic signature from VP Fundraising to the sponsorship contact for execution. Any authorized member of the Fundraising committee may send the agreement. The sponsor contact may reassign execution as needed and discuss with VP FUndraising <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-2U3j1hvFknD0zGFBovjZnMNWGnH-l35dBg93p3UTc/edit">modifying</a> the agreement. We do this for both new sponsorships and renewals <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZoeOkhUvDCv8jkuJUtyFur892YBHTHNINW0ozUMH-o/edit#">howto</a>. Upon completion of the electronic signature, the document is automatically sent to Accounting. If agreement execution happens outside of the digital signature platform (print/sign/scan), the Fundraising committee member sending the agreement manually forwards the executed agreement to Accounting and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qjZSWOgyCxlwE2XiWzFixMoK7e7Sth3n">stores</a> the agreement.</li>
<li>Accounting invoices the sponsor and receives payment. There may be additional documents requested (tax) or sponsor setup discussions (vendor onboarding systems) with the sponsor and procurement team. These are handled by Accounting, bringing VP Fundraising and VP Sponsor Relations as needed. Confirmation of payment is communicated to VP Fundraising and VP Sponsor Relations via the fundraising-private email list. VP Sponsor Relations sends a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDrw2TMQq9RMW3Lp7mRyZAMSwuMHat34XkTbbkN5fZA/edit">&quot;Thanks&quot; message</a> to the sponsor. VP Fundraising ensures the 'Thanks page' is updated to reflect the sponsor's level of sponsorship.</li>
<li>Thereafter, VP Sponsor Relations checks in with the sponsor, providing operational updates and thanking them quarterly for their ongoing support. Semi-anually retention asks are made and anmually we provide a report and information for a year-end gathering.</li>
<li>At renewal time, the cycle repeats, returning to the decision point in &quot;ongoing relationship&quot;.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Non-Sponsored - Handled by <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-fundraising">VP Fundraising</a> and <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-sponsor-relations">VP Sponsor Relations</a>. For various reasons, the decision is made to decline further (or new) sponsorship with the ASF. After an appropriate interval of time (determined during conversation with the sponsor), me renew contact with the potential sponsor to refresh the relationship and to gauge interest in establishing an ongoing sponsored relationshp. we end communications with the potential sponsor upon their request.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Offboarding - Handled by <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-fundraising">VP Fundraising</a> and <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/vp-sponsor-relations">VP Sponsor Relations</a>. When a sponsor decides to end a sponsored relationship, VP Fundraising removes the sponsor's note on the Thanks page (at the appropriate time). VP Sponsor Relations or VP Fundraising reaches out to the sponsor to thank them again for their sponsorship and performs an &quot;exit interview&quot; seeking information about whether there were any way we could have handled the relationship better. At this point, the relationship enters the &quot;Ongoing, unsponsored relationship&quot; phase.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Who can sponsor the ASF?</h5>
<p>This is on the main sponsorship page: <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#WhoCanSponsor">https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#WhoCanSponsor</a></p>
<p>In short, this policy exists to ensure that Sponsors truly are interested in furthering the Open Source, public-good mission of the ASF (and not self-serving means such as SEO).</p>
<h5>How do I gain access to Google Workspace (formerly GSuite)?</h5>
<p>Any <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/members.html">ASF Member</a> can gain access to Fundraising's Google Workspace. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:fundraising@apache.org">fundraising@apache.org</a> expressing your interest, and we will grant access as quickly as possible. We will create an account for you, and will send an activation link to your @apache.org email address. You must use this link within 48 hours, before it expires.</p>
<p>If you have access to the site and are ready to add someone, navigate to the folder you would like to grant access to, click the &quot;+ Add Members&quot; button and follow the on-screen prompts.</p>
<h5>What is targeted sponsorship?</h5>
<p>Download the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhZEcty2fSx7ZxiBs41j3qOUrqsA7TvKmQ13ZZ61lJY/export?format=pdf">fundraising policy</a>. The goal of targeted sponsorships is to provide sponsors a means to directly support a specific area of the foundation. This can be anything from particular infrastructure services to hosting a hackathon during a public event. The program provides recognition for those that support areas of the foundation through non-monetary contributions.</p>
<p>For an internal FAQ of the program as well as some guidelines around acceptance/usage criteria, have a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQjHHWZPP5Wh6Gyey69AkGBoyivujFjOSkEZmCBDyE8">this document</a>.</p>
<h5>What are the important documents I should know?</h5>
<p>All of them, of course! But, here's a quick, curated list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wzRtkWmHWws4ceEHQXgRTGj6c95aev8S?ths=true">Policies and templates</a> to get comms out easily and professionally</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cjY06T4VNe-BEvpTWPeDOgoKFrWfN6k-?ths=true">Pitch deck</a> - why someone should sponsor the ASF; customized for each pitch</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1h5H6hCJ95PX3BqYUc2RXRPdEE?ths=true">Meeting notes/agendas</a> from regular fundraising team telecons</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7wNkTj2wH_TV3drdzVnc3g5WjQ?ths=true">Graphics and content</a> for other sponsor outreach and programs</li>
</ul>
<h5>What vendor-provided services does Fundraising manage/use?</h5>
<p>Fundraising manages and uses a few vendor services to do our work. Some services are Targeted Donations to The ASF while others are services specific to Fundraising.</p>
<p>We store this private data in <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/Fundraising/service_relationships">the Fundraising section of foundation-private svn</a>.</p>
<h5>Any tips for effective use of Google Workspace?</h5>
<p>Sure! Once you obtain an account, you can do the following to &quot;live&quot; out of Google Workspace for your @apache.org address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to id.apache.org and forward your email to &gt;id&lt;@gsuite.cloud.apache.org</li>
<li>On Gmail, go your settings-&gt;Accounts</li>
<li>Set the &quot;send mail&quot; option to use your @apache.org account with the <a href="https://reference.apache.org/committer/email#sendingemailfromyourapacheorgemailaddress">outbound server information Infra has published</a></li>
<li>Make this send mail the default account</li>
<li>Under &quot;When replying to a message:&quot; Check the option to always reply from default address</li>
</ul>
<h5>Are there specific fundraising policies I should know about?</h5>
<p>Because we are interfacing with external entities in a sensitive area of operations (financial and PII data), it is important to interact with (potential) sponsors in an official capacity. Ensure outbound emails contain a signature with your title at the ASF and your relationship to the fundraising team. Hold synchronous conversations under the same auspices. While this is not vital to protect the ASF or the sponsor, it does provide you (as a volunteer individual) protections in the highly-unlikely event that something goes wrong (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil">piercing the corporate veil</a>).</p>
<h5>How does event sponsorship work?</h5>
<p>We have worked up an events planning and support model that seems to work for us. As we grow and improve the processes, we'll keep the following location updated:
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/events/event_sponsorship_process.md">https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/events/event_sponsorship_process.md</a></p>
<p>We have also defined an Event Sponsor Ambassador role on the event-planning team to ensure we support our sponsors, connect them to other events, and always have a backstop in case anything comes up
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/events/event_sponsor_ambassador.md">https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/events/event_sponsor_ambassador.md</a></p>
<h5>How do I edit this site?</h5>
<p>Edit this site using GitHub. If you are creating a new markdown (.md) page, consult an existing page for the correct structure of the header and page title. Each .md file must have a Title and Slug tag at the top to publish to the correct location. The site uses <a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf" target=_blank>GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>When you have completed your edits, submit a pull request. When someone approves the pull request, the site updates automatically.</p>
<h5>What is the process to appoint VP Sponsor Relations?</h5>
<p>See the <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/orgchart/vp-sponsor-relations">private org chart page</a> for V.P. Sponsor Relations.</p>
